The provision creates a 20-percent business income deduction, with some limits, for sole proprietors and owners in partnerships and other non-corporate enterprises. It was initially sold by Republicans as a way to help small businesses and create jobs. But the final formula for determining what types of businesses can benefit has widened to take in companies with few, if any, workers, critics said. “The president will try to tell the American people that his great political victory is a win for working people, but they see all the benefits going to his type of businesses: real estate pass-throughs,” Democratic Senator Jack Reed said on the Senate floor. Trump, a real estate developer, wants to sign the Republican tax bill into law this week, which would give Republicans their first major legislative victory of 2017. The House of Representatives and Senate were hurrying toward passage of the bill on Tuesday, with a final House vote set for Wednesday. On House Speaker Paul Ryan’s website, he said pass-through businesses employed about half of U.S. private-sector workers. High tax rates, he said, “discourage investment and job creation, discourage business activity, and put American businesses at a competitive disadvantage.” Pass-through businesses’ profits “pass through” their books directly to owners, unlike corporations, which parcel out profits through dividends to stockholders. Under existing law, pass-through owners pay the individual income tax rate on those profits, not the corporate rate. Under the Republican bill, the corporate rate would be slashed to 21 percent, while the top individual income tax rate, which some pass-through business owners pay, would be 37 percent. To address the disparity, Republicans included tax relief for pass-through owners in their bill, allowing them to deduct 20 percent of their pass-through business income. Republicans put in anti-abuse measures to ensure owners of bona fide business operations claim the 20 percent deduction and prevent high earners from seeking to recategorize their income as pass-through income to take advantage of the deduction. Republicans also capped the income eligible for the full 20-percent deduction at $315,000 for married couples and $157,500 for individuals. But they included a “capital element” in the formula for determining eligibility beyond those thresholds, presenting a lucrative tax break for some, including wealthy owners of commercial property, said tax experts. “This seems ideally suited for commercial property businesses, where there aren’t a lot of workers, but there is a lot of valuable property around,” said Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a think tank. Income above the pass-through caps can be eligible for the 20-percent deduction based on a formula: 50 percent of employee wages paid; or 25 percent of wages plus 2.5 percent of the value of qualified property at purchase, whichever is greater. “The idea is to use the sum of the ‘2.5 percent rule’ plus 25 percent of wages ... to get the full 20-percent deduction” on more income, said New York University School of Law Professor Daniel Shaviro, a tax law specialist, in an email. An assessment of the Republican bill by 13 tax experts, mostly academics, said the formula would “expand the ability of highly paid owners in certain industries – and particularly those heavy in property but light in employees, like real estate – to qualify for the pass-through deduction.” \n","Generating links\n","Tax bill's 'pass-through' rule will aid wealthy, not workers: critics\n","['https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-passthrough-idUSKBN1EE18O', 'https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/20/tax-bills-pass-through-rule-will-aid-wealthy-not-workers-critics-say.html', 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/tax-bills-pass-rule-aid-130139233.html', 'https://www.business-standard.com/article/reuters/tax-bill-s-pass-through-rule-will-aid-wealthy-not-workers-critics-117122000966_1.html', 'https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tax-bills-pass-rule-aid-185646742.html', 'https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/VALUE8-N-V-15311912/news/Tax-bill-s-pass-through-rule-will-aid-wealthy-not-workers-critics-25697265/', 'https://www.todayonline.com/world/tax-bills-pass-through-rule-will-aid-wealthy-not-workers-critics', 'https://www.metro.us/tax-bills-pass-through-rule-will-aid-wealthy-not-workers-critics/', 'https://www.malaymail.com/news/money/2017/12/20/tax-bills-pass-through-rule-will-aid-wealthy-not-workers-critics-say/1536899', 'https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/tax-bills-passthrough-rule-will-aid-wealthy-not-workers-critics-1012803']\n","Generating question-answers\n","question_ans :  [{'answer': 'President Donald Trump', 'question': 'Who is a wealthy business owner who can benefit from a provision in the Republican tax bill that creates a valuable deduction for pass-through'}, {'answer': '20-percent', 'question': 'What percentage of business income deduction is created by the Republican tax bill?'}, {'answer': 'to help small businesses and create jobs', 'question': 'What did Republicans initially sell the tax bill as a way to help small businesses?'}, {'answer': 'take in companies with few, if any, workers', 'question': 'What has the final formula for determining what types of businesses can benefit widened to?'}, {'answer': 'real estate pass-throughs', 'question': 'What does Jack Reed say the president will try to tell the American people that his great political victory is a win for working people?'}, {'answer': 'Trump', 'question': 'Who wants to sign the Republican tax bill into law?'}, {'answer': 'Tuesday', 'question': 'When did the House of Representatives and Senate hurry toward passage of the Republican tax bill?'}, {'answer': 'half', 'question': 'How many private sector workers did Paul Ryan say pass-through businesses employed?'}, {'answer': 'individual income tax rate', 'question': 'What do pass-through owners pay on their profits under existing law?'}, {'answer': '37 percent', 'question': 'What is the top individual income tax rate that some pass-through business owners pay?'}, {'answer': '20 percent', 'question': 'How much of their pass-through business income did Republicans deduct?'}, {'answer': '20 percent', 'question': 'What deduction did Republicans put in anti-abuse measures to ensure owners of bona fide business operations claim?'}, {'answer': '20-percent', 'question': 'What percentage of income did Republicans capped in the Republican tax bill?'}]\n","Generating answers with new links\n","Evaluating\n","matching_score :  69.23076923076923\n","sentence_bleu_score :  0.6923076923076923\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"2192e16aa4234f538df8b847b8a30c69","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"8c21e2291c18459f8869ad022d4ac8b9","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["sbertSimilarity :  0.9104030132293701\n","Data point :  75 (Reuters) - The U.S. tax overhaul as currently proposed will make housing less affordable, according to nearly half of the property market experts polled by Reuters, with another third saying it would not do anything to improve it. A decade on from the start of the crash that knocked more than a third off U.S. home values and led to a deep global recession, the housing market has bounced back smartly. U.S. house prices are expected to rise next year and in 2019, faster than predicted just a few months ago and at more than double the rate of underlying consumer inflation and wages. That is in sharp contrast to the outlook for Britain. [GB/HOMES] The S&P/Case Shiller composite index of U.S. home prices in 20 metropolitan areas is expected to gain 5.1 percent next year and 4.2 percent in 2019. The main challenge currently is a chronic shortage of homes, which is pushing prices beyond the reach of new buyers, who tend to be young and not particularly well-paid and, if university-educated, already saddled with huge amounts of debt. Now adding to those concerns is an effort by President Donald Trump’s administration to overhaul the tax code, which analysts say could undermine any potential improvements in affordability in the housing market. The Republican tax proposal allows interest payment deductions on mortgage debt up to $750,000, down from the current $1 million. The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on the tax bill on Tuesday afternoon, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said his chamber would vote on Tuesday evening. Twelve of 26 analysts who answered an extra question said the tax bill in its current form will probably make housing more expensive. Eight respondents said it would do nothing and only six expected it would improve affordability. “Losing the tax deduction of mortgage payments and property taxes - of having deductibility limited - makes housing less attractive and less affordable,” said Robert Brusca, chief economist at FAO Economics. But he added: “The Trump/Congress plan is such a not-well-thought-out-mess it’s hard to tell how it will impact people in a systematic way.” Asked to rate affordability on a scale of 1 being the cheapest and 10 the most expensive, the median answer was 6. While the latest consensus on U.S. housing affordability has not changed in more than a year of polling, the range of forecasts has narrowed. “We think there’s a possibility that if the tax bill is successful in generating economic growth, housing affordability could take a turn for the worse,” noted Ralph McLaughlin, economist at Trulia in San Francisco.  “This is because the housing market has a supply, not a demand problem, so any policies that generate growth without boosting supply could make homes even more expensive than they already are.” Another challenge has been lingering for years. While the unemployment rate has plunged to a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, annual wage growth has not broken above 2.9 percent since the Great Recession that ended about eight years ago. “Home prices have been appreciating circa 5-6 percent well above wage growth at 2-2.5 percent, decreasing affordability for the average buyer, particularly first-time homebuyers strapped with student loan debt and facing still modest labor market opportunities,” said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel in Chicago. She also pointed out that eliminating mortgage interest rate deductions will make housing less affordable.  The latest housing market data indicates that turnover is still far from the overheating boom rates from before the financial crisis. Existing home sales rose to a seasonally-adjusted annualized rate of 5.48 million units in October, but well below the peak above 7 million units in 2005.  Property analysts now forecast annualized existing home sales in each quarter next year to average 5.5-5.6 million, less than the 5.70-million-unit pace hit in March, which was the highest since February 2007.  Those latest projections were also weaker than expected in a Reuters poll in August. But data on Monday showed U.S. single-family homebuilding and permits rose in November to a level not seen since August 2007 and confidence among homebuilders soaring to near an 18-1/2-year high in December, in a hopeful sign for a housing market that has been struggling with supply constraints. The U.S. Federal Reserve expects to raise interest rates three times next year. While lifting short-term rates won’t necessarily push up longer-term market rates, the path of least resistance is higher. Still, the latest Reuters consensus for mortgage rates was lower than what was forecast in the previous survey in August. The 30-year mortgage rate is expected to average 4.24 percent next year, rising to 4.65 percent in 2019 and 5.00 percent in 2020. Analysts were evenly split in the poll on whether a faster pace of rate hikes from the Fed would significantly slow activity.  “If there are more than three hikes, it is likely that the Fed would be responding to stronger economic growth pushing inflation up – and that stronger growth would offset the rise in rates,” said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance in Columbus, Ohio. \n","Generating links\n","U.S. tax cuts won't make housing more affordable: analysts\n","['https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-property-poll-idUSKBN1ED2EN#:~:text=%28Reuters%29%20-%20The%20U.S.%20tax%20overhaul%20as%20currently,it%20would%20not%20do%20anything%20to%20improve%20it.', 'https://www.brookings.edu/policy2020/votervital/how-can-government-make-housing-more-affordable/', 'https://www.brookings.edu/policy2020/votervital/how-can-government-make-housing-more-affordable/', 'https://www.brookings.edu/policy2020/votervital/how-can-government-make-housing-more-affordable/', 'https://www.brookings.edu/policy2020/votervital/how-can-government-make-housing-more-affordable/', 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-tax-cuts-wont-housing-more-affordable-analysts-190947823--sector.html', 'https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/u-tax-cuts-wont-housing-more-affordable-analysts-064717712--sector.html', 'https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/u-tax-cuts-wont-housing-064717508.html', 'https://www.brookings.edu/policy2020/votervital/how-can-government-make-housing-more-affordable/', 'https://www.investing.com/news/economy/us-tax-cuts-wont-make-housing-more-affordable-analysts-1010415', 'https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/us-tax-cuts-wont-make-housing-more-affor-idUSKBN1ED2EN', 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com/u-tax-cuts-wont-housing-more-affordable-analysts-190947823--sector.html', 'https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/us-tax-cuts-wont-make-housing-more-affordable-analysts-1010415', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/7l0pe2/analysts_tax_cuts_wont_make_housing_more/']\n","Generating question-answers\n","question_ans :  [{'answer': 'half', 'question': 'How many property market experts say the U.S. tax overhaul will make housing less affordable?'}, {'answer': 'a third', 'question': 'What percentage of U.S. home values were knocked off by the crash?'}, {'answer': 'more than double the rate of underlying consumer inflation and wages', 'question': 'What is the rate of U.S. house prices expected to rise in 2019?'}, {'answer': 'Britain', 'question': 'What is the outlook for U.S. house prices in Britain?'}, {'answer': '4.2 percent', 'question': 'What is the S&P/Case Shiller composite index expected to gain in 2019?'}, {'answer': 'a chronic shortage of homes', 'question': 'What is the main challenge of the U.S. tax overhaul?'}, {'answer': 'overhaul the tax code', 'question': \"What does Trump's administration want to do to improve affordability in the housing market?\"}, {'answer': '$750,000', 'question': 'The Republican tax proposal allows interest payment deductions on mortgage debt up to what?'}, {'answer': 'Senate Majority Leader', 'question': 'Who is Mitch McConnell?'}, {'answer': 'Twelve', 'question': 'How many analysts said the tax bill would make housing more expensive?'}, {'answer': 'Eight', 'question': 'How many respondents said the tax bill would do nothing?'}, {'answer': 'FAO Economics', 'question': \"What company is Robert Brusca's chief economist?\"}, {'answer': 'the cheapest and 10 the most expensive', 'question': 'What is the average rate of affordability in the U.S.?'}]\n","Generating answers with new links\n","Evaluating\n","matching_score :  38.46153846153847\n","sentence_bleu_score :  0.38461538461538464\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"bbb068a14e9b40bebf771b1d867ba9aa","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"41433df1eaad40719b7f7986799e797a","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["sbertSimilarity :  0.7574611902236938\n","Data point :  76 NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sweeping U.S. tax legislation appears to be on the verge of approval, lifting the prospects in particular for banks, telecoms, transports and other industries that stand to gain the most from lower corporate tax rates. The Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives hit a last-minute snag on Tuesday in their drive to approve the legislation favored by President Donald Trump. The plan on Capitol Hill was for the Senate to delete three offending provisions in the House version and vote on the bill, then send it back to the House for a vote on Wednesday. The bill slashes the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. That would boost overall earnings for S&P 500 companies by 9.1 percent, according to UBS equity strategists. For an interactive graphic on how the bill ripples through industries: tmsnrt.rs/2kf26gx Momentum behind the tax bill over the past month has helped propel the stock market, which had already rallied sharply this year, to fresh record highs. The S&P 500 has climbed about 5 percent since mid-November when the House of Representatives passed its tax overhaul bill. But the bill, which also includes a one-time tax on profits held overseas and industry-specific measures, would benefit some stocks, industries and sectors more than others.  The industries that stand to benefit most from the lower rates are telecoms, transportation, retail and banks, analysts said. But for some groups, such as tech and healthcare, the impact is more mixed.  Domestically geared healthcare companies that focus on services are poised to benefit from the lower tax rate. Hospital operator Universal Health Services Inc, lab-testing company Quest Diagnostics Inc and drug wholesaler Cardinal Health Inc are among the service companies set to benefit the most, according to Mizuho Securities. “We believe tax reform should be a significant positive cash flow event, especially for healthcare services companies that tend to have limited international exposure and significant capital expenditures,” Mizuho analysts said in a research note. While many large drugmakers already report adjusted tax rates in the low 20 percent range, a number of companies would benefit from the ability to bring back overseas cash, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said in a recent note. According to Schott, Pfizer Inc, with $160 billion in offshore earnings, and Merck & Co Inc, with $70 billion, are particularly poised to gain from repatriating overseas funds. Banks are expected to be among the biggest winners from a lower tax rate. The S&P 500 banks index has soared 9 percent since mid-November as the tax bill began moving swiftly through Congress.     Of the major S&P sectors, financials pay the highest effective tax rate at 27.5 percent, according to a Wells Fargo analysis of historical tax rates. Large U.S. banks will see an average 13 percent increase to earnings per share from the lower rate, according to Goldman Sachs analysts, with Wells Fargo & Co and PNC Financial Services Group having the biggest gains. Citizens Financial Group, Regions Financial Corp and M&T Bank Corp would see sizable earnings benefits and are also poised to be relative winners among large bank stocks, UBS analyst Saul Martinez said in a recent note. Banks could benefit indirectly if the tax bill provides an economic boost that spurs increased lending and higher interest rates. The technology sector, which had led the market’s rally for most of 2017, has underperformed the S&P 500 as the tax bill moved forward in Congress. Tech is expected to benefit less than most other sectors from a drop in the corporate rate, with an earnings boost of 5.3 percent, according to UBS. Semiconductors, whose shares have had a particularly rough ride in the past month, are expected to see earnings drop by 3.3 percent due to the overall bill, according to UBS. “Many chip companies have extensive international operations and relatively low blended tax rates,” Wells Fargo analysts said in a recent note. “We see the possibility of changes in the U.S. tax rules as a potential risk for such companies.” One area where large tech companies could benefit is by spending cash held overseas for uses such as stock buybacks that boost earnings per share. UBS points to Cisco Systems Inc and Qualcomm Inc as companies that could see among the biggest buyback boosts. “The tech sector would certainly be among the largest beneficiaries if cash stashed overseas can be repatriated at a low rate and presumably used for stock buybacks or dividends,” according to a recent note from Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. \n","Generating links\n","Banks, healthcare service firms among winners from U.S. tax bill\n","['https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-stocks-idUSKBN1ED2Q9#:~:text=Domestically%20geared%20healthcare%20companies%20that%20focus%20on%20services,to%20benefit%20the%20most%2C%20according%20to%20Mizuho%20Securities.', 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/banks-healthcare-firms-among-winners-064717580.html', 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/banks-healthcare-firms-among-winners-212355937.html', 'https://news.yahoo.com/banks-healthcare-firms-among-winners-u-tax-bill-064717006--sector.html', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/banks-healthcare-service-firms-among-winners-from-u-s-tax-bill', 'https://www.kitco.com/news/2017-12-19/GRAPHIC-Banks-healthcare-service-firms-among-winners-from-U-S-tax-bill.html', 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com/graphic-banks-healthcare-firms-among-211755038.html', 'https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/r-graphic-banks-healthcare-service-firms-among-winners-from-us-tax-bill-2017-12-1011654647', 'https://uktopnewssources.wordpress.com/2017/12/19/banks-healthcare-service-firms-among-winners-from-us-tax-bill/', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/rageagainstthetoupee/comments/7kwenj/banks_healthcare_service_firms_among_winners_from/']\n","Generating question-answers\n","question_ans :  [{'answer': 'lower corporate tax rates', 'question': 'What is the biggest advantage of tax legislation in the U.S.?'}, {'answer': 'Donald Trump', 'question': 'Who was the president of the U.S. House of Representatives?'}, {'answer': 'Senate', 'question': 'Who did the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives want to delete three offending provisions in the House version?'}, {'answer': '21 percent', 'question': 'What is the corporate income tax rate slashed to?'}, {'answer': '9.1 percent', 'question': 'What is the overall earnings of S&P 500 companies?'}, {'answer': 'tmsnrt.rs/2kf26gx', 'question': 'What is the name of the graphic on how the tax bill ripples through industries?'}, {'answer': '5 percent', 'question': 'How much has the S&P 500 climbed since mid-November?'}, {'answer': 'one-time tax on profits held overseas and industry-specific measures', 'question': 'What kind of tax bill would benefit stocks, industries and sectors more than others?'}, {'answer': 'telecoms, transportation, retail and banks', 'question': 'What are the industries that stand to benefit most from the lower rates?'}, {'answer': 'tech and healthcare', 'question': 'What are some groups that benefit most from lower corporate tax rates?'}, {'answer': 'lower tax rate', 'question': 'What are healthcare companies poised to benefit from?'}, {'answer': 'Universal Health Services Inc', 'question': 'What is the name of the hospital operator that is set to benefit most from lower corporate tax rates?'}, {'answer': 'Mizuho', 'question': 'What analyst said tax reform should be a significant positive cash flow event for healthcare services companies that tend to have limited international exposure and significant capital expenditures?'}, {'answer': 'JPMorgan', 'question': 'Which analyst said companies would benefit from the ability to bring back overseas cash?'}, {'answer': 'Pfizer', 'question': 'What is the name of Pfizer?'}]\n","Generating answers with new links\n","Evaluating\n","matching_score :  46.666666666666664\n","sentence_bleu_score :  0.4666666666666667\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"3373f6253b2b44b8b10c7326eb1325a1","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"afa98839144742d38015da666eed2230","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["sbertSimilarity :  0.7697760462760925\n","Data point :  77 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Eight months into his lifetime U.S. Supreme Court appointment, Neil Gorsuch has given every indication through his votes in key cases and remarks from the bench he will be a stalwart of the conservative legal agenda, as President Donald Trump promised. Still early in his career as a justice that could span decades, Gorsuch has already established himself as among the most conservative members of the top U.S. court, and has not been shy about expressing his views, sometimes in idiosyncratic ways. He also has made public appearances before conservative audiences, including a speech at the Republican president’s Trump International Hotel in downtown Washington, that have drawn rebukes by liberal critics who questioned his independence from the president who nominated him. Gorsuch’s record so far suggests “he is going to be a reliably conservative vote,” said Carolyn Shapiro, a law professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law. Trump, who as a candidate promised to pick a justice in the mold of the late conservative icon Antonin Scalia, has set out to move the federal judiciary to the right. Gorsuch’s appointment has been his biggest step yet toward that goal, restoring the high court’s 5-4 conservative majority. Gorsuch’s April confirmation by the Republican-led Senate, despite strong Democratic opposition, provided one of Trump’s  biggest political victories since taking office in January.  Writing about Gorsuch on Twitter on Tuesday, Trump said he was “very proud of him and the job he is doing,” and rejected a Washington Post report that he had considered rescinding Gorsuch’s nomination this spring after the jurist said attacks on the judiciary like those that had been made by Trump were “disheartening” and “demoralizing.”  The newspaper reported that Trump had vented angrily to advisers that Gorsuch may not be sufficiently loyal. Trump responded that he had “never even wavered.” As the court rolls into 2018 with some big rulings ahead - on free speech, gay rights, voting rights and employee rights - legal experts said Trump will be able to rely on Gorsuch. The new justice has delivered key votes backing Trump’s travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority countries and on the death penalty, and embraced certain kinds of public funding for churches. During arguments this month in one of the court’s biggest cases of its current term, Gorsuch signaled sympathy for a conservative Christian baker who contends he was within his constitutional rights to refuse to create a wedding cake for a gay couple. Gorsuch declined an interview request for this article. Inside the Supreme Court chambers and outside it, Gorsuch, a 50-year-old Coloradoan, speaks his mind. “He is not intimidated about being the newest justice,” said John Malcolm, a lawyer at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank. Gorsuch has regularly sided with his fellow conservative justices. In the legal fight over the three versions of Trump’s travel ban, Gorsuch sided with the president on four different occasions. In June, he was one of three justices who would have let Trump’s second travel ban go into full effect. The court voted 6-3 to allow a limited version of the ban. On the death penalty, Gorsuch was among four conservative dissenters when the court in September granted a stay of execution for a Georgia inmate. In April, in his first recorded vote on the court, he was part of a 5-4 conservative majority that declined a stay of execution request from an Arkansas inmate. The court in 2018 is set to rule on two cases - one from Wisconsin and another from Maryland - involving the practice of drawing legislative districts in states in a way intended to entrench one party in power, known as partisan gerrymandering. The rulings could influence U.S. elections for decades. Based on the Oct. 3 oral argument in the Wisconsin case, in which Democratic voters challenged a Republican-drawn electoral map, it is unclear how the court will rule. Gorsuch used a culinary analogy to express his doubts during the argument about the Democratic challengers’ legal theory. “It reminds me a little bit of my steak rub,” Gorsuch said. “I like some turmeric, I like a few other little ingredients, but I’m not going to tell you how much of each. And so what’s this court supposed to do, a pinch of this, a pinch of that?” During a November speech hosted by the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group, Gorsuch confidently touted his judicial ideology, stressing the importance of interpreting the U.S. Constitution based on its original meaning and narrowly reading the text of laws passed by Congress. “Tonight,” he said to sustained applause, “I can report, a person can be both a committed originalist and textualist and be confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States.” \n","Generating links\n","Trump's Supreme Court appointee Gorsuch plots rightward course\n","['https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-gorsuch-idUSKBN1EE0IJ', 'https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/26/politics/trump-kavanaugh-gorsuch-barrett-supreme-court/index.html', 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-supreme-court-appointee-gorsuch-120000581.html', 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-supreme-court-appointee-gorsuch-060000391.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/26/politics/trump-kavanaugh-gorsuch-barrett-supreme-court/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/26/politics/trump-kavanaugh-gorsuch-barrett-supreme-court/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/26/politics/trump-kavanaugh-gorsuch-barrett-supreme-court/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/26/politics/trump-kavanaugh-gorsuch-barrett-supreme-court/index.html', 'https://sg.news.yahoo.com/trumps-supreme-court-appointee-gorsuch-plots-rightward-course-060415689.html', 'https://news.trust.org/item/20171220060952-s861n', 'https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/trumps-supreme-court-appointee-gorsuch-plots-rightward-course-1012367', 'https://www.investing.com/news/politics/trumps-supreme-court-appointee-gorsuch-plots-rightward-course-1012367', 'https://mckoysnews.com/neil-gorsuch-plots-rightward-course/', 'https://news.yahoo.com/trumps-supreme-court-appointee-gorsuch-plots-rightward-course-060415689.html']\n","Generating question-answers\n","question_ans :  [{'answer': 'Donald Trump', 'question': 'Who promised Gorsuch to be a stalwart of the conservative legal agenda?'}, {'answer': 'expressing his views', 'question': 'What has Gorsuch not been shy about?'}, {'answer': 'Trump International Hotel', 'question': 'What hotel did Gorsuch speak at?'}, {'answer': 'Carolyn Shapiro', 'question': 'Who said Gorsuch is going to be a reliably conservative vote?'}, {'answer': 'Antonin Scalia', 'question': 'Who did Gorsuch promise to pick a justice in the mold of?'}, {'answer': '5-4', 'question': 'How many conservatives did Gorsuch restore in the high court?'}, {'answer': 'Democratic', 'question': \"What type of opposition did Gorsuch's confirmation by the Republican-led Senate provide one of Trump's biggest political victories since taking office in January\"}, {'answer': 'he had “never even wavered.”', 'question': 'What did Trump say about Gorsuch?'}, {'answer': 'the death penalty', 'question': \"What has the new justice delivered key votes backing Trump's travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority countries?\"}]\n","Generating answers with new links\n","Evaluating\n","matching_score :  66.66666666666666\n","sentence_bleu_score :  0.6666666666666666\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"6dda559ab1fe4b0fb11d76f59901b98f","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"7ad90484f433462a80258b6b8998e815","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["sbertSimilarity :  0.8399377465248108\n","Data point :  78 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Republican lawmakers told the U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday that they want to question three senior FBI officials about an investigation of then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton over her handling of classified information while she was secretary of state. The lawmakers, who are leading a joint probe into the Clinton investigation, said in a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, that they wanted to speak with FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, FBI Chief of Staff Jim Rybicki and FBI counsel Lisa Page beginning on Thursday. The FBI declined to comment on the letter and referred reporters to the Justice Department. The request to meet the FBI officials for “transcribed interviews” was made after Republicans obtained more than 300 text messages sent last year between Page and FBI agent Peter Strzok critical of then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. The text messages called him an “idiot” and “a loathsome human,” among other things, according to copies reviewed by Reuters. Strzok later worked for Special Counsel Robert Mueller as part of the investigation into Russian efforts to interfere in the U.S. election and ties between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. Moscow denies U.S. allegations of election meddling and Trump denies any campaign collusion.  Strzok, who helped lead the investigation of Clinton’s handling of classified material, was removed from Mueller’s team after the special counsel became aware of the texts critical of Trump. Republican lawmakers have attacked Mueller, expressing concern about potential bias among his investigators. But Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has testified to lawmakers that  he was “not aware” of any impropriety by Mueller’s team. Representative Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and Representative Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, are conducting a joint review of the FBI’s handling of the Clinton investigation. In their letter to Sessions and Rosenstein, they said they were looking into several decisions by the FBI during the Clinton investigation, including then-FBI Director James Comey’s decision not refer Clinton’s case for prosecution. \n","Generating links\n","Republicans seek to question FBI officials in Clinton probe: letter\n","['https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-congress-idUSKBN1EE0A6', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-russia-congress-idINKBN1EE0AV', 'https://news.yahoo.com/republicans-seek-fbi-officials-clinton-probe-letter-031514596.html', 'https://sg.news.yahoo.com/republicans-seek-fbi-officials-clinton-probe-letter-031652461.html', 'https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/lawmakers-question-fbi-officials-review-clinton-probe/story?id=55644798', 'https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/19/gop-chairmen-seek-interviews-with-top-fbi-officials-306345', 'https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/28/politics/oversight-judiciary-investigation/index.html', 'https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2017/12/20/republicans-seek-to-question-fbi-officials-in-clinton-probe--letter/', 'https://www.investing.com/news/politics/republicans-seek-to-question-fbi-officials-in-clinton-probe-letter-1012197', 'https://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2017/12/19/Republicans-seek-question-FBI-officials-Clinton-probe-letter']\n","Generating question-answers\n","question_ans :  [{'answer': 'Hillary Clinton', 'question': 'What was the name of the Republican presidential candidate that was investigated by the FBI?'}, {'answer': 'Jeff Sessions', 'question': 'Who was the Attorney General of the United States?'}, {'answer': 'Justice Department', 'question': 'What department did the FBI refer reporters to?'}, {'answer': 'more than 300', 'question': 'How many text messages were sent last year between Page and Strzok?'}, {'answer': 'an “idiot” and “a loathsome human,” among other things', 'question': 'What did the text messages call Hillary Clinton?'}, {'answer': 'Special Counsel Robert Mueller', 'question': 'Who did Strzok work for as part of the investigation into Russian efforts to interfere in the U.S. election?'}, {'answer': 'Moscow', 'question': 'Who denies allegations of election meddling?'}, {'answer': 'Strzok', 'question': \"Who helped lead the investigation of Clinton's handling of classified material?\"}, {'answer': 'potential bias', 'question': \"What did Republican lawmakers feel about Mueller's investigation?\"}, {'answer': 'Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein', 'question': \"Who has testified to lawmakers that he was not aware of any impropriety by Mueller's team?\"}, {'answer': 'House Oversight Committee', 'question': 'What committee is Trey Gowdy chairman of?'}, {'answer': 'James Comey', 'question': 'Who was the FBI director of the FBI during the Clinton investigation?'}]\n","Generating answers with new links\n","Evaluating\n","matching_score :  75.0\n","sentence_bleu_score :  0.75\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"654e0d838b1e40a490fd6378b53aa00a","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"2635853e7fc14c6689da1b672f973d8e","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["sbertSimilarity :  0.9397900700569153\n","Data point :  79 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Near the end of President Donald Trump’s rocky first year in office, White House aides view imminent victory on a tax overhaul as a starting point to strengthen his weak approval ratings ahead of key congressional elections next November. Some Republicans said any effort at a political turnaround must include reining in Trump’s habit of lashing out at critics on Twitter. White House aides said they recognized that Trump’s poll numbers needed to start rising to limit the damage in 2018 elections in which his fellow Republicans’ continued control of Congress will be at stake. A Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives and Senate could jeopardize Trump’s agenda. “We have to grow, we have to move up, and I think having more successes like the tax vote will be important to us,” said a senior White House official. Administration officials said Trump would seek to use momentum generated from the biggest tax rewrite in 30 years to help propel other legislative priorities, including an infrastructure program and welfare reform. Final passage of the Republican tax bill is expected on Wednesday in what would be Trump’s first major legislative victory since taking office in January. But the tax bill carries risks. Republicans insist it will boost the economy and job growth. Democrats condemn it as a giveaway to corporations and the rich. In a Reuters/Ipsos poll, some 52 percent of adults said they opposed the tax plan, while 27 percent supported it. Unless Trump practices greater discipline, some Republican strategists see disaster looming in the congressional elections, in which a third of the 100-member Senate and all 435 seats in the House will be up for grabs. “Stop tweeting and start the new year with a new level of message discipline. Just try it. It’ll work. And you’ll get those poll numbers back up,” said Republican strategist Scott Reed. “They’ve got to focus on that job approval number because it’s a historic death watch for midterm elections. The record is strong. His discipline is key for year two,” Reed said. Trump has repeatedly caused controversy with early morning tweets, particularly those aimed at individuals. He raised hackles recently when he tweeted that Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand “would do anything” for campaign donations. “There are definitely moments that we’d all like to see stop,” one senior aide said. “Some of the early morning stuff has not been helpful over the last few weeks.” There has been some talk in the White House and among Trump’s outside advisers about hiring a senior political adviser akin to former President Barack Obama’s political aide David Axelrod or former President George W. Bush’s adviser Karl Rove. The White House political director, Bill Stepien, is seen as a more data-driven adviser. Trump, who sees himself as his own strategist, does not have anyone steeped in politics like his former White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, or former chief strategist Steve Bannon. Aides said there was some discussion of getting Trump into events with smaller settings in order to show a more personal side of the president. His standard appearance is to go to an event, deliver a speech to a big crowd and leave.    Trump is up against a historical trend in which the party that holds the White House typically loses seats in the first congressional elections after a president’s initial two years in office.  Democratic President Bill Clinton had a 46 percent approval rating in November 1994 and his party still lost 54 seats in the House and eight in the Senate. Trump was at 41 percent in a mid-December poll from NBC News and the Wall Street Journal. Republican strategist Ford O’Connell said Trump had done much to keep his conservative base of support happy but had to expand his popularity. To do that, he needs to ease voters’ concerns about his fitness for office. “What he has to do to win over people like independents and never-Trumpers is make the American people feel comfortable with him as president,” said O’Connell. “His achievements are quite striking, but he’s just not connecting (with the public).” \n","Generating links\n","Trump aides hope win on taxes will stem slide in poll numbers\n","['https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-idUSKBN1EE07U', 'https://news.yahoo.com/trump-aides-hope-win-taxes-stem-slide-poll-022307369.html', 'https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-aides-hope-win-taxes-stem-slide-poll-022307369.html', 'https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-aides-hope-win-taxes-stem-slide-poll-023142094.html', 'https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/trump-aides-hope-win-on-taxes-will-stem-slide-in-poll-numbers-1012147', 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-aides-hope-win-taxes-stem-slide-poll-023142094.html', 'https://indianexpress.com/article/world/donald-trump-aides-hope-win-on-taxes-will-stem-slide-in-poll-numbers-4991336/', 'https://www.metro.us/trump-aides-hope-win-on-taxes-will-stem-slide-in-poll-numbers/', 'https://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2017/12/19/Trump-aides-hope-win-taxes-will-stem-slide-poll-numbers', 'https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6c0f6v']\n","Generating question-answers\n","question_ans :  [{'answer': 'a tax overhaul', 'question': \"What did White House aides view as a starting point to strengthen Trump's weak approval ratings?\"}, {'answer': 'reining in Trump’s habit of lashing out at critics on Twitter', 'question': 'What did some Republicans say any effort at a political turnaround must include?'}, {'answer': 'to limit the damage in 2018 elections', 'question': \"What did White House aides say Trump's poll numbers needed to start rising?\"}, {'answer': 'Democratic', 'question': \"What type of takeover could jeopardize Trump's agenda?\"}, {'answer': 'infrastructure program and welfare reform', 'question': 'What did administration officials say Trump would seek to use momentum generated from the biggest tax rewrite in 30 years to propel other legislative priorities?'}, {'answer': 'Wednesday', 'question': 'When is the final passage of the Republican tax bill expected?'}, {'answer': 'the tax bill carries risks', 'question': \"What is Trump's first major legislative victory since taking office in January?\"}, {'answer': 'boost the economy and job growth', 'question': 'What do Republicans say the tax bill will do?'}, {'answer': 'corporations and the rich', 'question': 'What do Democrats condemn the tax bill as a giveaway to?'}, {'answer': '52', 'question': 'How many adults opposed the tax plan in a Reuters/Ipsos poll?'}, {'answer': 'a third', 'question': 'What percentage of the Senate seats in the House will be up for grabs?'}, {'answer': 'start the new year with a new level of message discipline', 'question': 'What do some Republican strategists say Trump should stop tweeting and start the new year with a new level of message discipline?'}, {'answer': 'It’ll work', 'question': 'What is a new level of message discipline?'}, {'answer': 'Scott Reed', 'question': \"Who is the Republican strategist who said Trump's poll numbers are back up?\"}, {'answer': 'it’s a historic death watch for midterm elections', 'question': \"What is Scott Reed's job approval number?\"}, {'answer': 'strong', 'question': \"What is Trump's record for year two?\"}, {'answer': 'year two', 'question': \"What year is Trump's discipline key for?\"}, {'answer': 'individuals', 'question': \"Who did Trump's tweets aimed at?\"}, {'answer': 'Kirsten Gillibrand', 'question': 'Who was the Democratic Senator who raised hackles when he tweeted that Trump would do anything for campaign donations?'}]\n","Generating answers with new links\n","Evaluating\n","matching_score :  42.10526315789473\n","sentence_bleu_score :  0.47368421052631576\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"5a142390e1ba4b81af90bae40142a1f8","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"fd20c211230f4f3fbf579a887cb0d237","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["sbertSimilarity :  0.7708210945129395\n","Data point :  80 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress is struggling through another contentious week as infighting over defense spending, healthcare and other matters complicates the drive to pass a temporary spending bill by midnight on Friday to avert a partial government shutdown. In a week when President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans in Congress are hoping to celebrate the passage of tax overhaul legislation, many in the party showed little appetite for a government shutdown at week’s end. But they sounded resigned to having to navigate through some drama over a package that includes so many disparate components, which could make for a messy process. “I’m going to vote for whatever I need to, to keep the government open,” Republican Representative Chris Collins told reporters. The last time government agencies had to shut down because Washington could not pay its bills was in October 2013. Leading Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives expressed optimism that a funding bill, coupled with a large new disaster aid package, would pass by Friday’s deadline. But some were predicting that lawmakers would bump right up against the cutoff. The House could vote as soon as Wednesday on legislation that extends most funding for domestic programs through Jan. 19. Democrats are likely to mainly oppose the bill, arguing that their priorities are being ignored. Conservative Republicans are insisting on higher military funding through the rest of the fiscal year ending on Sept. 30 as part of the House bill. Democrats in the Senate are expected to block that formula if, as expected, it does not also have more money for non-defense programs. The House measure would also include $81 billion in disaster funding to help Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and several U.S. states recover from hurricanes, wildfires and other natural disasters. That price tag has made some Republicans uneasy. Some Republicans are also worried about a Senate strategy to add a bipartisan healthcare proposal to the government funding bill, in keeping with a promise Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made in order to coax Republican Senator Susan Collins to vote for the tax legislation. Conservative House Republicans do not like the bipartisan healthcare proposal because it would fund subsidies for low-income participants in the Obamacare health insurance program, and does not include language that restricts federal funds for abortion. McConnell’s promise to Collins “means squat over here,” said Representative Mark Walker, chairman of the Republican Study Committee, the largest group of conservatives in the House. Some conservatives may vote against the funding bill in protest, he told reporters outside the House. The House bill also would extend the Children’s Health Insurance Program for five years. If Democrats continue to withhold their support for the stopgap spending bill and some Republicans peel off, Congress could find itself struggling to pass a bill as the clock ticks toward midnight on Friday. \n","Generating links\n","Congress faces tricky path to avoid government shutdown\n","['https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-shutdown-idUSKBN1ED1X9', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-congress-shutdown-idINKBN1ED2BR', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/congress-scrambles-avoid-government-shutdown-days-deadline-n1285084', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/congress-scrambles-avoid-government-shutdown-days-deadline-n1285084', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/congress-scrambles-avoid-government-shutdown-days-deadline-n1285084', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/congress-scrambles-avoid-government-shutdown-days-deadline-n1285084', 'https://www.npr.org/2022/12/15/1142386863/congress-passes-continuing-resolution-avoid-government-shutdown', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/congress-scrambles-avoid-government-shutdown-days-deadline-n1285084', 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-congress-faces-tricky-path-171430605.html', 'https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/lawmakers-in-congress-reach-agreement-to-avert-government-shutdown', 'https://news.yahoo.com/house-republicans-seek-govt-funding-jan-19-aide-150149980--business.html', 'https://news.yahoo.com/u-congress-faces-tricky-path-avoid-government-shutdown-172140040--business.html', 'https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/573526-congress-facing-shutdown-debt-crisis-with-no-plan-b/', 'https://www.thegazette.com/nation-world/u-s-congress-faces-tricky-path-to-avoid-government-shutdown/']\n","Generating question-answers\n","question_ans :  [{'answer': 'midnight', 'question': 'When did Congress pass a temporary spending bill to avert a partial government shutdown?'}, {'answer': 'President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans in Congress', 'question': 'Who is hoping to celebrate the passage of tax overhaul legislation?'}, {'answer': 'messy process', 'question': 'What could a government shutdown make for?'}, {'answer': 'Chris Collins', 'question': 'Who was the Republican Repertant for WASHINGTON?'}, {'answer': 'October 2013', 'question': 'When was the last time government agencies had to shut down because Washington could not pay its bills?'}, {'answer': 'a funding bill, coupled with a large new disaster aid package, would pass by Friday’s deadline', 'question': 'What did Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives say would pass by Friday?'}, {'answer': 'bump right up against the cutoff', 'question': 'What were some Republicans predicting lawmakers would do to a funding bill that extends most funding for domestic programs through Jan. 19?'}, {'answer': 'Jan. 19', 'question': 'When could the House vote on legislation that extends most funding for domestic programs?'}, {'answer': 'Democrats', 'question': 'Who is likely to oppose the bill?'}, {'answer': 'Sept. 30', 'question': 'On what date did the fiscal year end?'}, {'answer': 'Democrats in the Senate are expected to block that formula if, as expected, it does not also have more money for non-defense programs', 'question': 'What are Democrats in the Senate expected to block?'}, {'answer': '$81 billion', 'question': 'How much money would the House measure include in disaster funding to help Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and several U.S. states recover'}, {'answer': 'price tag', 'question': 'What has made some Republicans uneasy about a bipartisan healthcare proposal?'}, {'answer': 'Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell', 'question': 'Who promised to coax Senator Susan Collins to vote for the tax bill?'}, {'answer': 'it would fund subsidies for low-income participants in the Obamacare health insurance program', 'question': 'Why do Republicans dislike the bipartisan healthcare proposal?'}]\n","Generating answers with new links\n","Evaluating\n","matching_score :  46.666666666666664\n","sentence_bleu_score :  0.4666666666666667\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"69e6684c9ac245e7b34bf53899bf2ad2","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"62d2e281b51f4d2e94184d3f0b48a625","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["sbertSimilarity :  0.6664371490478516\n","Data point :  81 (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress is weighing military spending, healthcare and other major decisions tied to a temporary funding bill to keep the government operating beyond Friday, as lawmakers rush to begin a year-end recess. Republicans control the House of Representatives and Senate, but disagreements between the two chambers, along with differences between Republicans and Democrats, make for potentially difficult days ahead. The following are the big initiatives under consideration: Money expires at midnight on Friday for the operation of most federal agencies. That is because Congress has failed to approve the regular appropriations bills for the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1 and Washington has been operating on a series of temporary funding bills. The House is proposing another temporary extension - one that would run through Jan. 19, 2018. It is unclear whether the Senate would stick with that date or seek a slightly later one to give Congress more time to write legislation funding agencies through Sept. 30. President Donald Trump is pushing for a significant increase in defense spending. Conservatives in Congress want to include that money in the stopgap funding bill this week. But Senate Democrats are expected to block it until negotiators can reach a deal on coupling more non-defense spending with a bigger military budget. Congress is likely to include $81 billion to help Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and several states recover from severe hurricanes, wildfires and other natural disasters. The Children’s Health Insurance Program, which helps provide medical care to nearly 9 million children in low-income families, is slated for a five-year renewal by the House. But the Senate might balk at the way it is structured. It was unclear whether it would opt for temporary funding. The Senate might attach a bipartisan measure that maintains healthcare subsidies for low-income people participating in the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Many House Republican lawmakers dislike that idea. The National Security Agency’s warrantless internet surveillance program under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act could be renewed, but there are competing versions of such legislation in the House and Senate.

The committee voted 13-10 against Scott Garrett as EXIM president in a rebuke to conservatives who saw the former New Jersey Republican congressman as an ally who would keep tight controls on the government export lender.  Garrett helped lead a 2015 effort to shut down EXIM to end a source of “corporate welfare” for giant manufacturers such as Boeing Co and General Electric. After his nomination he pledged to keep the bank “fully open” but struggled to persuade senators that he now believed in the bank’s core mission of providing taxpayer-backed loans and guarantees for U.S. export transactions. “I believe he’s a principled man who simply believes in the abolishment of the bank,” said Senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota, who voted against Garrett along with South Carolina Republican Tim Scott and all Democrats on the panel. The White House’s director of legislative affairs, Marc Short, commented, “We are disappointed that the Senate Banking Committee missed this opportunity to get the Export Import Bank fully functioning again. We will continue to work with the committee on a path forward.”  The committee, however, approved Trump’s nominations for EXIM’s first vice president, Kimberly Reed, and three other board members: former Louisiana congressman Spencer Bachus, Claudia Slacik and Judith DelZoppo Pryor. It also approved Mark Greenblatt as the agency’s inspector general. Confirmation of at least three board members will allow EXIM to resume approval of loans and guarantees above $10 million, returning the United States to export financing for major projects such as commercial aircraft, power turbines and  petrochemical plants for the first time since June 2015.  GE in a statement urged quick confirmation of the remaining EXIM nominees and hailed the committee vote as “a milestone for manufacturers across the U.S. whose customers require a fully-functioning EXIM Bank.” EXIM has a $42 billion backlog of deals in its pipeline awaiting approval, representing about 250,000 U.S. jobs based on Bureau of Labor Statistics multiplier data, said Scott Schloegel, an Obama administration appointee who still serves as the bank’s top officer.     Schloegel said with EXIM’s extended absence from large-scale export finance, many U.S. exporters have been unable to compete with China for some major projects in the power and technology sectors. \n","Generating links\n","Senate panel snubs Trump's pick to run EXIM, OKs other nominees\n","['https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-eximbank-idUSKBN1ED234', 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-senate-panel-snubs-trumps-184127087.html', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trade-eximbank-idINL1N1OJ17O', 'https://news.yahoo.com/senate-panel-rejects-garrett-exim-bank-oks-other-155926850--business.html', 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com/1-u-senate-panel-snubs-184127306.html', 'https://www.investing.com/news/politics/senate-panel-rejects-garrett-for-exim-bank-oks-other-nominees-1009528', 'https://srnnews.com/senate-panel-snubs-trumps-pick-to-run-exim-oks-other-nominees-2/', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/7kvswj/senate_panel_snubs_trumps_pick_to_run_exim_oks/', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6U8eBljLP0', 'https://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2017/12/19/Senate-panel-rejects-Garrett-EXIM-Bank-OKs-other-nominees']\n","Generating question-answers\n","question_ans :  [{'answer': 'four', 'question': 'How many other board nominees were approved by the U.S. Senate Banking Committee?'}, {'answer': '13-10', 'question': 'How many votes did the Senate Banking Committee vote against Scott Garrett?'}, {'answer': 'Boeing Co and General Electric', 'question': 'What two giant manufacturers did Garrett lead a 2015 effort to shut down EXIM to end a source of “corporate welfare”?'}, {'answer': 'he pledged to keep the bank “fully open”', 'question': 'What did Garrett do after his nomination?'}, {'answer': 'Tim Scott', 'question': 'Who did Senator Mike Rounds vote against?'}, {'answer': 'Marc Short', 'question': \"Who was the White House's director of legislative affairs?\"}, {'answer': 'Kimberly Reed', 'question': \"Who was EXIM's first vice president?\"}, {'answer': 'Mark Greenblatt', 'question': \"Who was EXIM's inspector general?\"}, {'answer': 'at least three', 'question': 'How many board members did EXIM have?'}, {'answer': 'GE', 'question': 'Who urged quick confirmation of the remaining EXIM nominees?'}]\n","Generating answers with new links\n","Evaluating\n","matching_score :  60.0\n","sentence_bleu_score :  0.6\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"bd182981563147d49be877c05d10c66a","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"e2805dd102b940f6a0dda500cbe0188e","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["sbertSimilarity :  0.8336871266365051\n","Data point :  84 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The No. 2 Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives said on Tuesday the House would likely need to vote again on tax legislation on Wednesday morning given that Democrats in the Senate were likely to prevail on a procedural objection.

Story:\t\t The biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax system in more than 30 years could be signed into law by President Donald Trump as soon as Wednesday, if both chambers of Congress approve it. The bill passed the House by a vote of 227-203, overcoming united opposition from Democrats and 12 Republicans who voted against it. “The bond market today is reassessing the whole thing now that it looks like it’s going to pass. We’ve had a pretty significant rise in yields - we’re back up close to the highs for the quarter. “Stocks on the other hand have been in front of this for a long time, I think initially because lower taxes means more earnings are retained and then companies can distribute those to shareholders or not. But either way, it’s likely to be beneficial to stock prices.” JACK ABLIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BMO PRIVATE BANK, CHICAGO “The tax rate we’ve certainly priced in (in stocks), though I certainly expected smallcaps to do a little bit better coming into this vote. What I think is not priced in yet is the economic impact of the incentives. It still remains to be seen what businesses will actually do. Will they buy equipment, invest in technology, hire more workers?” “The assumption right now is financial engineering, buybacks, dividend increases, is where the incentives will go. Redeploying cash, recapitalizing balance sheets, maybe debt repayment.” “I do think there’s a fair amount of skepticism these benefits will ultimately result in expansions. I’m getting a sense investors are pricing in the one-time tax pop, we’ll see if there’s any follow through next year.” On the rise in Treasury yields: “It’s been a monetary policy-led expansion, now we get a fiscal boost and some may be concerned (that) the boost on the fiscal side (may) be offset by monetary tightening.  “The big question (for the dollar) is how other central banks will respond to this (U.S.) fiscal stimulus package. That’s probably what’s weighing on investors’ minds right now - celebrating the tax package but recognizing that what central banks have given us in the last years they could begin to take away.” JIM PAULSEN, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, THE LEUTHOLD GROUP, MINNEAPOLIS “As we look back on this a little bit, I really think it might be buy the rumor sell the news. Wall Street has had long enough to vet this thing. And it has been known for a long time that something was going to pass here, at least for the last 30, 45 days. Whether it was going to be 21 percent rate or 20 percent rate is not that significant. It’s more the general parts of it were pretty much known and vetted and I think implemented into the market... If you look at the relative performance in the market today, it’s fairly clearly more of a shot towards better economic growth or even inflation... I think the biggest move today of anything is bond yields. That’s the big story.” AARON KOHLI, INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK “They seem to have locked up all the necessary votes... I think the markets are still trying to figure out how much should we expect, will people react right away, what will be the second order effects?  “There are a lot of questions that still haven’t answered. The first one is, assuming it goes into effect Jan. 1, when is the first time people start seeing any changes in their pay checks? And the answer is it could be a couple of months. Even then for most of middle America you aren’t going to see the savings until tax time, which means you may not see it until April 2019. I’m not sure that’s early enough to help midterms and I think that’s really where the markets’ are going to start to focus next. How do we handicap what it does for Republicans in the midterms? Does it help them? Does it do nothing for them? Or it may even hurt them.” BRIAN PEERY, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, HENNESSY FUNDS IN NOVATO, CALIFORNIA “The market is taking kind of a breather, digesting the news. The market is off a little bit, maybe because the bill is not as popular as the GOP hoped it would be in the public opinion. The overall market looks still really strong and healthy.” “Looking at companies in our portfolio, (the tax bill) will be great for domestic small- and mid-cap companies paying a 30, 35 percent effective tax rate. A lot of them do not have the ability to move profits offshore... I’ll wait and see how much, but I can see another 5 percent rise (in the market) in the next few months as the tax bill kicks in.” ALICIA LEVINE, DIRECTOR OF PORTFOLIO STRATEGY AT BNY MELLON INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK:  “The effects of the tax cuts will be immediately accretive to corporate earnings which will support equity markets. Also, the tax package will be positive for growth in the real economy. “The tax cuts add $10 to baseline S&P earnings for 2018 putting 2018 expected earnings at $156 or a 19 percent growth rate over 2017 earnings... This is supportive of equity markets; sectors to focus on would be small caps, value and financials.”   PAUL NOLTE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT IN CHICAGO: “It’s pretty much along party lines. The takeaway is more buy the rumor, sell the news. The market has been rallying over the last week or so in anticipation of this vote. We’re (now) going to be looking toward the government funding bill.” “It’s going to take time to see how the general population reacts to it (tax). The expectation is companies are going to bring back a lot of dollars back to the United States and put it into plant and equipment. It very well may go into stock buybacks and dividend increases. There’s no certainty we’re going to get the promised economic gain everybody’s been talking about.” CHUCK CARLSON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, HORIZON INVESTMENT SERVICES, HAMMOND, INDIANA “I think the market had been pretty well expecting this. I don’t think there’s any ... surprise here to the market. The momentum had been pretty strong in the last two weeks in terms of getting this done, and I think the market has pretty well anticipated getting it done.” “You may see some reactions going forward in certain sectors and subcategories. Maybe you see smallcaps pick up a little bit more. Maybe you see the transports, which have lagged large caps, start to do a little bit better. But in the main, the market had already been factoring this in.” “It has a lot of potential ramifications. It’s going to certainly play a role in the midterm elections next year, and people are going to have some time to try to evaluate whether their plight in life is better because of it before they go to the voting booth next year. So from a political standpoint it has impact.” OMAIR SHARIF, SENIOR U.S. ECONOMIST, SOCIETE GENERALE, NEW YORK “This seems like it’s a done deal especially if Corker and Collins end up on board on the Senate side. They will get across the finish line by Christmas after moving the goal post a number of times.  “I think for more than a few days now, this was likely going to pass. This has been baked in the cake with the markets. They have been expecting this for a long time. It’s a few days before Christmas, so trading is quite thin. I wouldn’t read too much into any market reaction. The real telling thing for this is the second half of next year, whether this actually lifts growth above 3 percent on any sustained basis on capital spending and consumer spending. It’s more a political achievement than an economic achievement.” Stocks trimmed losses slightly, but then dipped back. The S&P 500 Index was last down 0.3 percent.

From 2008 through 2012, the employment office for Congress paid more than $166,000 in public money to settle eight claims against lawmakers alleging sexual harassment or discrimination, according to data it provided on Tuesday to Representative Gregg Harper, the Republican chairman of the House Administration Committee who is drafting a bill to overhaul how Congress handles sexual harassment. The Office of Compliance previously said it has resolved three other cases since 2013. Provisions in settlement agreements and other legal limits block the office from disclosing details of the payouts it has made on behalf of lawmakers, including identities of those involved, an issue that has come to light as allegations of misconduct swirl around Capitol Hill.  A growing wave of women reporting abuse or misconduct has brought down powerful men recently, from movie producer Harvey Weinstein to popular television personality Matt Lauer, as well as one of the longest-serving Democrats in Congress, former Representative John Conyers.  Harper said on Tuesday he hopes to file a bipartisan bill by Wednesday evening overhauling how Congress handles sexual harassment that would include making lawmakers personally liable for settlements. “They should have to reimburse” the government for payouts, he told reporters. “There’s no doubt that members have made it clear that taxpayer dollars should not be used for the purposes of settling a sexual harassment claim.” Harper expects swift action, with the House voting on the bill next month. Democratic Representative Jackie Speier, who has proposed similar legislation and has been working with Harper and other Republicans, said she was “thrilled” about the bill.  Bipartisan legislation on sexual harassment was introduced in the Senate last week. In a letter to Harper the compliance office’s executive director said it had paid $354,465.85 to settle 16 total claims of employment discrimination, retaliation and harassment from fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2012. According to the letter, eight claims included sexual  harassment or discrimination, and often involved other violations such as breaking federal wage rules. Two claims were simply categorized as “retaliation” while the rest were focused on racial, age or disability discrimination. The largest amount paid over those years was $85,000, labeled as “sexual harassment and harassment because of retaliation.”  The office does not have investigatory authority and cannot probe allegations, said Executive Director Susan Tsui Grundmann in the letter.  Settlements typically have nondisclosure provisions, she said, adding the office has not found an admission of liability in any of the settlement documents. \n","Generating links\n","Bill could make Congress members liable for harassment payouts\n","['https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-harassment-idUSKBN1ED2OH', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-harassment-idUSKBN1F72XL', 'https://www.factcheck.org/2018/10/a-misleading-17-million-hush-money-claim/', 'https://www.factcheck.org/2018/10/a-misleading-17-million-hush-money-claim/', 'https://www.factcheck.org/2018/10/a-misleading-17-million-hush-money-claim/', 'https://www.factcheck.org/2018/10/a-misleading-17-million-hush-money-claim/', 'https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/legal-and-compliance/employment-law/Pages/Congress-Passes-Sexual-Harassment-Reform.aspx', 'https://www.hrreporter.com/focus-areas/wellness-mental-health/bill-could-make-us-congress-members-liable-for-harassment-payouts/286862', 'https://news.yahoo.com/bill-could-u-congress-members-liable-harassment-payouts-204859000.html', 'https://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2017/12/19/Bill-could-make-US-Congress-members-liable-harassment-payouts', 'https://www.factcheck.org/2018/10/a-misleading-17-million-hush-money-claim/', 'https://www.politicususa.com/2017/12/19/bill-congress-members-liable-harassment-payouts.html', 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/congress-sexual-assault-charges/', 'https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/21/16679292/secret-fund-pays-victims-sexual-harassment-the-hill']\n","Generating question-answers\n","question_ans :  [{'answer': 'nearly a dozen', 'question': 'How many cases of misconduct have public funds been used to settle?'}, {'answer': 'more than $166,000', 'question': 'How much did the employment office for Congress pay in public money from 2008 to 2012?'}, {'answer': 'three', 'question': 'How many cases have the Office of Compliance resolved since 2013?'}, {'answer': 'allegations of misconduct swirl around Capitol Hill', 'question': 'What has the Office of Compliance come to light as?'}, {'answer': 'Harvey Weinstein', 'question': 'Who is a movie producer who has brought down powerful men?'}, {'answer': 'Wednesday', 'question': 'What day did Harper say he hopes to file a bipartisan bill?'}, {'answer': 'They should have to reimburse” the government for payouts', 'question': 'What did Harper say he hopes to file a bipartisan bill to make lawmakers personally liable for settlements?'}, {'answer': 'taxpayer dollars', 'question': 'What amount of money should not be used for the purposes of settling a sexual harassment claim?'}, {'answer': 'Jackie Speier', 'question': 'Who is the Democratic Rep. who has proposed similar legislation?'}, {'answer': 'Senate', 'question': 'When was bipartisan legislation on sexual harassment introduced?'}, {'answer': '$354,465.85', 'question': 'How much did the executive director of the compliance office pay to settle 16 claims of employment discrimination, retaliation and harassment?'}, {'answer': 'eight', 'question': 'How many claims did the compliance office pay to settle?'}, {'answer': 'racial, age or disability', 'question': 'What type of discrimination did the rest of the lawsuits focus on?'}, {'answer': '$85,000', 'question': 'How much was the largest amount paid over those years?'}]\n","Generating answers with new links\n","Evaluating\n","matching_score :  64.28571428571429\n","sentence_bleu_score :  0.6428571428571429\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"96490d97ce544c9eb1032a7c5e2bef90","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"5c199af4e25848f593d7814fbab02a6f","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["sbertSimilarity :  0.8476195335388184\n","Data point :  88 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A coalition of nearly 20 environmental and Native American tribal groups sued the Trump administration on Tuesday, challenging its delay of a rule limiting emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas methane from oil and gas drilling operations on federal lands. Earlier this month, the Bureau of Land Management, part of the Department of the Interior, suspended implementation of the rule for a year, until Jan. 17, 2019, saying it wanted to avoid compliance costs for energy companies as it revises the regulation. The delay “is yet another action taken by the Trump administration to benefit the oil and gas industry at the expense of the American public, particularly the millions of Westerners” who use public lands for ranching, hunting, hiking and other purposes, Darin Schroeder, a lawyer with the Clean Air Task Force, said in a statement. His organization represented the National Wildlife Federation, one of the groups that filed the lawsuit against Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and his department. Energy companies say the rule, finalized at the end of the Obama administration in 2016, could cost them tens of thousands of dollars per well.  The Trump administration is expected to announce a new draft rule in coming weeks, in line with its policy of maximizing output of oil, gas and coal and dismantling regulations it says prevent job growth.  The rule targets accidental leaks and intentional venting of methane from drilling operations on public lands, where about 9 percent of the country’s natural gas and 5 percent of its oil were produced last fiscal year. Some of its 2017 provisions have already been phased in, but the majority of them have yet to go into effect. The lawsuit, also filed by the Sierra Club, the Environmental Defense Council, and the Diné Citizens Against Ruining Our Environment, a Navajo group, seeks to stop the delay and force the Interior Department to implement the rule in January. It was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco.  The Interior Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. \n","Generating links\n","Green groups sue Trump administration over delay of methane rule\n","['https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-climate-lawsuit-idUSKBN1ED2N8', 'https://news.yahoo.com/green-groups-sue-trump-administration-over-delay-methane-202503037.html', 'https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/492795-13-states-green-groups-sue-trump-administration-over-energy/', 'https://earthjustice.org/news/press/2020/tribal-and-environmental-groups-sue-trump-administration-over-methane-emissions-rollbacks', 'https://www.eenews.net/articles/greens-sue-trump-for-delaying-obama-methane-rule/', 'https://www.sej.org/headlines/green-groups-sue-trump-administration-over-delay-methane-rule', 'https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/457375-green-groups-sue-trump-for-gutting-obama-power-plant-rules/', 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com/green-groups-sue-trump-administration-202503278.html', 'https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/341728-greens-sue-epa-over-smog-rule-delay/', 'https://news.trust.org/item/20171219203038-0p30c/']\n","Generating question-answers\n","question_ans :  [{'answer': '20', 'question': 'How many tribal groups sued the Trump administration on Tuesday?'}, {'answer': 'Jan. 17, 2019', 'question': 'When did the Bureau of Land Management suspend implementation of the rule?'}, {'answer': 'Darin Schroeder', 'question': 'Who was the lawyer for the Clean Air Task Force?'}, {'answer': 'National Wildlife Federation', 'question': 'What is the name of the group that filed the lawsuit against Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke?'}, {'answer': 'tens of thousands of dollars', 'question': 'How much did the Obama administration say the rule could cost them per well?'}, {'answer': 'maximizing output of oil, gas and coal and dismantling regulations it says prevent job growth', 'question': \"What is the Trump administration's policy?\"}, {'answer': '9 percent', 'question': \"How much of the country's natural gas was produced last fiscal year?\"}, {'answer': 'the Sierra Club, the Environmental Defense Council, and the Diné Citizens Against Ruining Our Environment', 'question': 'Who filed the lawsuit against the Trump administration?'}, {'answer': 'San Francisco', 'question': 'Where was the Northern District of California filed?'}, {'answer': 'The Interior Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.', 'question': 'How did the Interior Department respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit?'}]\n","Generating answers with new links\n","Evaluating\n","matching_score :  50.0\n","sentence_bleu_score :  0.5\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"ca2707dddeb7461ca902855700974392","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"7b7fc87a71c64e0e9ca81462b7c49e1e","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["sbertSimilarity :  0.8183903694152832\n","Data point :  89 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives, said on Tuesday that House Democratic leaders are asking their rank-and-file members to vote against a stopgap government funding bill, according to a CNN reporter on Twitter.

As the Republicans’ self-imposed Friday voting deadline loomed, Senators Susan Collins and Mike Lee each said they had decided to back the legislation hammered out last week among Republicans from the Senate and House of Representatives.  “The first major overhaul of our tax code since 1986, this legislation will provide tax relief to working families, encourage the creation of jobs right here in America and spur economic growth that will benefit all Americans,” Collins said on the floor of the Senate while announcing her support. The Maine Republican had been undecided on the legislation.  Lee had been similarly undecided until the Utah Republican tweeted earlier in the day that he would “proudly” vote for the bill.   The House of Representatives, which is also expected to adopt the bill, was due to vote first at around 1:30 p.m. (1830 GMT) on Tuesday, Republican aides said. The Senate vote is expected to follow either later on Tuesday or on Wednesday. “We will get it on the president’s desk for him to sign into law before Christmas, as we pledged,” predicted No. 2 Senate Republican John Cornyn, who said the Senate would begin 10 hours of debate after receiving the House-approved measure. White House officials said on Monday that Vice President Mike Pence, who would cast the tiebreaking vote in the Senate if necessary, was delaying his trip to Egypt and Israel this week to be in Washington for the vote on the tax plan. “The tax vote is still in very good shape, but we don’t want to take any chances,” a White House official said. The package of tax cuts for businesses and individuals, if enacted, would overhaul the U.S. tax code for the first time in more than 30 years and give Republicans their first major legislative victory of Trump’s presidency. Republicans, who believe they must act to preserve their House and Senate majorities in next year’s congressional elections, insist the tax cuts will drive U.S. economic growth higher and create jobs. Democrats, who oppose it, describe the legislation as a giveaway to corporations and wealthy Americans that will add $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade while raising taxes on some middle-class taxpayers.   Lawmakers in the House, where Republicans hold a 239-193 seat majority, are expected to approve the legislation largely along party lines. A smattering of “no” votes is likely from Republican fiscal hawks and lawmakers from New York, New Jersey and California who oppose a provision that would scale back a popular deduction for state and local taxes.   Both the House and Senate must approve the measure before Trump can sign it into law. The 100-seat Senate, where Republicans have only a 52-48 majority, proved to be the graveyard for last summer’s Republican drive to overturn former Democratic President Barack Obama’s healthcare law, when three Republicans opposed the measure. The tax overhaul has also faced challenges. But the specter of failure appeared to lift on Monday, as Congress closed in on final votes. Senate Republicans can afford to lose no more than two votes if they intend to pass tax legislation, and they are already down one vote. Senator John McCain, who is undergoing treatment for brain cancer, will not be available to support the bill because he is spending time with family in Arizona.   With support from Collins and Lee, only Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona remained undecided. A fifth Republican, Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi, has missed votes for health reasons this year but was expected to be on hand to support the tax bill. Republican Senator Bob Corker, a fiscal hawk, voted against the initial Senate bill but has said he will support final legislation. \n","Generating links\n","Republicans appear all but certain to pass tax legislation\n","['https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-idUSKBN1EC2Q7', 'https://news.yahoo.com/u-republicans-appear-certain-pass-tax-legislation-035505250--business.html', 'https://news.yahoo.com/republicans-appear-certain-pass-tax-legislation-222450598--business.html', 'https://au.news.yahoo.com/republicans-appear-all-but-certain-to-pass-tax-legislation-38346725.html', 'https://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/susan-collins-mike-lee-yes-votes/2017/12/18/id/832444/', 'https://www.metro.us/republicans-appear-all-but-certain-to-pass-tax-legislation/', 'https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2017/12/19/us-republicans-appear-all-but-certain-to-pass-tax-legislation/', 'https://www.npr.org/2017/12/19/571885876/republicans-appear-to-have-all-the-vote-to-pass-tax-plan', 'https://www.wenatcheeworld.com/news/national/u-s-republicans-appear-all-but-certain-to-pass-tax-legislation/article_605a89e8-8a1f-5725-9d07-d1c1e6d98f91.html', 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com/republicans-appear-certain-pass-tax-222450619.html']\n","Generating question-answers\n","question_ans :  [{'answer': 'two', 'question': 'How many Senate Republican holdouts agreed to support a tax overhaul backed by President Donald Trump?'}, {'answer': 'Senate and House of Representatives', 'question': 'Who did Senators Susan Collins and Mike Lee say they had decided to back the tax bill?'}, {'answer': 'the floor of the Senate', 'question': 'On what floor of the Senate did Collins say they would support the tax overhaul?'}, {'answer': 'Maine', 'question': 'Which republican had been undecided on the tax bill?'}, {'answer': 'Utah', 'question': 'Which republican tweeted that he would vote for the tax bill?'}, {'answer': '1:30 p.m. (1830 GMT)', 'question': 'When was the House of Representatives due to vote on Tuesday?'}, {'answer': 'Tuesday or on Wednesday', 'question': 'On what day is the Senate vote expected to follow?'}, {'answer': 'John Cornyn', 'question': 'Who said the Senate would begin 10 hours of debate after receiving the House-approved measure?'}, {'answer': 'Mike Pence', 'question': 'Who would cast the tiebreaking vote in the Senate if necessary?'}, {'answer': 'The tax vote is still in very good shape, but we don’t want to take any chances', 'question': 'What did the White House official say is still in good shape?'}, {'answer': 'Republicans', 'question': 'Who believe the tax cuts will drive U.S. economic growth higher and create jobs?'}, {'answer': 'Democrats', 'question': 'Who opposes the tax bill?'}]\n","Generating answers with new links\n","Evaluating\n","matching_score :  41.66666666666667\n","sentence_bleu_score :  0.4166666666666667\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"bb8401e6cd2b48d389fa199cfe3f7583","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"12bf7aa4658849d6b2ff915040ac4b2c","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["sbertSimilarity :  0.7867386937141418\n","Data point :  93 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. District Court judge ruled on Monday that President Donald Trump’s administration must allow access to abortion for two pregnant teenagers who are in the country illegally, escalating a high-profile legal fight. Judge Tanya Chutkan put her order on hold, however, to give the U.S. Justice Department time to appeal her ruling.  The Justice Department filed its notice of appeal shortly afterward to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The judge’s temporary restraining order marked the latest chapter in a legal dispute with the Trump administration over whether minors who are illegal immigrants have the right to seek an abortion during their detention. The issue was ignited by a 17-year-old who petitioned the court in October to have an abortion, and ultimately had the procedure over the Trump administration’s objections.  In that instance, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled on Oct. 24 that the teen could have an abortion immediately, rejecting the administration’s opposition. The two 17-year-olds in the latest legal action, known to the court as Jane Roe and Jane Poe, requested abortions, but the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement has refused to allow them access to the procedure. In her ruling, Chutkan wrote that the girls’  “constitutional right to decide whether to carry their pregnancies to term” needed to be preserved.  She also noted they were likely to succeed on the legal merits of their case, based on the prior ruling in the higher court. “We are deeply disappointed in the decision to grant a temporary restraining order that will compel HHS to facilitate abortions for minors when they are not medically necessary,” a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement. “A pregnant minor who has entered the country illegally has the option to voluntarily depart to her home country or identify a suitable sponsor. HHS-funded facilities that provide temporary shelter and care for unaccompanied alien minors should not become way stations for these children to get taxpayer-facilitated abortions.”  \n","Generating links\n","Court orders Trump administration to give immigrant teens abortion access\n","['https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-abortion-idUSKBN1ED08B', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-abortion-immigrant-idUSKCN1TF28A', 'https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/court-rules-against-trumps-abortion-policy-for-immigrant-teens-in-government-shelters', 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-orders-trump-administration-to-let-two-immigrant-teens-get-abortions/', 'https://thehill.com/regulation/381511-trump-admin-asks-court-to-hold-order-on-migrant-teens-access-to-abortion/', 'https://apnews.com/b8f17d1b9a1040debb9bc4210c9d7ac0', 'https://news.yahoo.com/court-orders-trump-administration-immigrant-teens-abortion-access-025143860.html', 'https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/court-orders-trump-administration-stop-blocking-abortion-young-immigrant-women-us', 'https://cms.trust.org/item/20171219025652-4ekoa', 'https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/18/abortion-detained-teen-immigrants-304113']\n","Generating question-answers\n","question_ans :  [{'answer': 'President Donald Trump', 'question': 'Who did a U.S. District Court judge rule was required to allow access to abortion for two pregnant teenagers?'}, {'answer': 'Tanya Chutkan', 'question': 'Who put the order on hold to allow the U.S. Justice Department time to appeal the ruling?'}, {'answer': 'U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit', 'question': 'Who did the Justice Department file its notice of appeal to?'}, {'answer': 'temporary restraining order', 'question': 'What was the latest chapter in a legal dispute with the Trump administration?'}, {'answer': '17', 'question': 'How old was the teen who petitioned the court in October to have an abortion?'}, {'answer': 'Oct. 24', 'question': 'When did the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rule that the teen could have an abortion?'}, {'answer': 'Jane Roe and Jane Poe', 'question': 'Who were the two 17-year-olds in the latest legal action known as?'}, {'answer': 'the girls’ “constitutional right to decide whether to carry their pregnancies to term” needed to be preserved', 'question': 'What did Chutkan write about the legal rights of the two 17-year-olds?'}, {'answer': 'prior ruling in the higher court', 'question': 'What did Chutkan say the girls were likely to succeed on the legal merits of their case?'}, {'answer': 'a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services', 'question': 'What was the name of the spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services?'}, {'answer': 'voluntarily depart to her home country or identify a suitable sponsor', 'question': 'What is the option of a pregnant minor who has entered the country illegally?'}, {'answer': 'way stations', 'question': 'What should HHS-funded facilities not become for unaccompanied alien minors to get taxpayer-facilitated abortions?'}]\n","Generating answers with new links\n","Evaluating\n","matching_score :  41.66666666666667\n","sentence_bleu_score :  0.5\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"c03b82b6abc149adb9b758fee95d4c5b","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"06087b9e5836439cba7003bda22fca8c","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["sbertSimilarity :  0.7731854319572449\n","Data point :  94 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives unveiled on Monday an $81 billion aid package to deal with hurricanes and wildfires, far above President Donald Trump’s $44 billion request. The legislation would help Puerto Rico and several states recover from devastating hurricanes and California and other Western states cope with wildfires. It was unclear whether the latest natural-disaster aid plan would be rushed through the Republican-controlled Congress this week, before the start of a Christmas recess, or await congressional votes early next year. The bill, introduced by House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, includes $27.6 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and $26.1 billion for community development block grants.  “We have a commitment to our fellow citizens that are in the midst of major rebuilding efforts in all areas, including Texas, Florida, California, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands,” Frelinghuysen, a New Jersey Republican, said in a statement.     Earlier this year, Congress approved two disaster aid packages totaling about $52 billion. Trump’s $44 billion request submitted in mid-November was widely criticized by lawmakers as being insufficient. About a third of Puerto Rico’s residents are still without power and hundreds remain in shelters three months after Hurricane Maria devastated the island. In California, wildfires have burned more than 1 million acres (400,000 hectares) and destroyed thousands of homes. \n","Generating links\n","House plan would increase Trump's disaster aid request\n","['https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-storms-aid-idUSKBN1EC2S4', 'https://news.yahoo.com/house-plan-increase-trumps-disaster-aid-request-024121278--business.html', 'https://au.news.yahoo.com/house-moves-to-increase-trumps-disaster-aid-request-38347724.html', 'https://www.sej.org/headlines/house-plan-would-increase-trumps-disaster-aid-request', 'https://sg.news.yahoo.com/house-plan-increase-trumps-disaster-aid-request-024121278--business.html', 'https://news.trust.org/item/20171218233329-r82sv', 'https://au.news.yahoo.com/house-plan-would-increase-trumps-disaster-aid-request-38349886.html', 'https://jp.reuters.com/article/us-usa-storms-aid-idUSKBN1EC2S4', 'https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/house-moves-to-increase-trumps-disaster-aid-request-1006825', 'https://www.democraticunderground.com/11042064']\n","Generating question-answers\n","question_ans :  [{'answer': '$81 billion', 'question': 'How much did the U.S. House of Representatives pay to deal with hurricanes and wildfires?'}, {'answer': 'hurricanes', 'question': \"What was the name of the hurricane that caused Puerto Rico's hurricanes and wildfires?\"}, {'answer': 'a Christmas recess', 'question': 'What is the start of the natural disaster aid plan?'}, {'answer': '$27.6 billion', 'question': 'How much did the House Appropriations Committee charge for the Federal Emergency Management Agency?'}, {'answer': 'New Jersey', 'question': 'What country was Frelinghuysen?'}, {'answer': '$52 billion', 'question': 'How much did the two disaster aid packages cost?'}, {'answer': '$44 billion', 'question': \"What was Trump's $81 billion request?\"}, {'answer': 'three months', 'question': \"How long did Puerto Rico's residents stay in shelters after Hurricane Maria?\"}, {'answer': '1 million acres', 'question': 'How many acres of land have been burned in California?'}]\n","Generating answers with new links\n","Evaluating\n","matching_score :  44.44444444444444\n","sentence_bleu_score :  0.4444444444444444\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"713b592e7bdc469c95ebb89576f0b44f","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"fb3f4171ec684549a47fbcc1fd4b8fe3","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["sbertSimilarity :  0.7724484205245972\n","Data point :  95 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Appropriations Committee introduced a bill on Monday to provide $81 billion in emergency aid for recent hurricanes and wildfires.

In an article published in May, Harp raises questions about the role of adolescent neuroscience in the courtroom and writes that the best way to tackle juvenile justice is by teaching youth to accept responsibility and involve them in community-based diversion programs to prevent them from re-offending.      “Misplaced reliance on nascent neuroscience and neuroimaging evidence to remove from youth and young adults the consequences of their criminal behavior invites pushback from those who favor a retributive system, and it may create some unintended and unwanted consequences for youth and young adults,” she writes. It is unclear when the Senate may consider Harp’s nomination. There are a handful of key nominees who have been waiting months now for their confirmation votes. Nominees to head the Criminal, Civil and National Security divisions, for instance, are still pending. \n","Generating links\n","Trump nominates Liberty University professor to Justice Department post\n","['https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-justice-harp-idUSKBN1ED05A', 'https://jp.reuters.com/article/us-usa-justice-harp-idUSKBN1ED05A', 'https://news.yahoo.com/trump-nominates-liberty-university-professor-justice-department-post-015147807.html', 'https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/365579-trump-nominates-liberty-university-professor-for-doj-job/', 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-nominates-liberty-university-professor-014825690.html', 'https://au.news.yahoo.com/trump-nominates-liberty-university-professor-to-justice-department-post-38349532.html', 'https://democraticunderground.com/1016198525', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/7kqgh1/trump_nominates_liberty_university_professor_to/', 'https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/trump-nominates-liberty-university-professor-to-justice-department-post-1007137', 'https://www.investing.com/news/politics/trump-nominates-liberty-university-professor-to-justice-department-post-1007137']\n","Generating question-answers\n","question_ans :  [{'answer': 'Caren Harp', 'question': 'Who did Trump call Liberty University School of Law professor?'}, {'answer': 'U.S. Senate', 'question': \"Who would be responsible for the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention?\"}, {'answer': 'National Juvenile Justice Prosecution Center', 'question': \"What was Harp's previous role at the American Prosecutors Research Institute?\"}, {'answer': 'Lynchburg, Virginia', 'question': \"Where is Caren Harp's sixth year as a professor at Liberty?\"}, {'answer': 'Christian', 'question': 'What kind of worldview does the Liberty University School of Law offer?'}, {'answer': 'teaching youth to accept responsibility and involve them in community-based diversion programs to prevent them from re-offending', 'question': 'What is the best way to tackle juvenile justice?'}, {'answer': 'pushback', 'question': 'What does reliance on nascent neuroscience and neuroimaging evidence invite from those who favor a retributive system?'}, {'answer': 'Senate', 'question': \"Who may consider Harp's nomination?\"}, {'answer': 'a handful', 'question': 'How many nominees have been waiting months for confirmation votes?'}, {'answer': 'Criminal, Civil and National Security', 'question': 'What divisions are still pending?'}]\n","Generating answers with new links\n","Evaluating\n","matching_score :  70.0\n","sentence_bleu_score :  0.7\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"257db406eea64eb9a72e487bed2a3886","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"a152f8f6ae074e4e8fa858da33328b89","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["sbertSimilarity :  0.9197705388069153\n","Data point :  97 The following statements were posted to the verified Twitter accounts of U.S. President Donald Trump, @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS.

Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson will travel to Puerto Rico, where about a third of the island’s 3.4 million residents are still without power, hundreds remain in shelters, and thousands have fled to the U.S. mainland. The visit comes as Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Monday were planning to unveil a disaster aid package totaling $81 billion, according to a senior congressional aide. Some of that aid would go to Puerto Rico, but also to states like Texas and Florida that were hit by other hurricanes and to California, which is grappling with wild fires. Even before Maria savaged Puerto Rico, the island was contending with $72 billion in debt. Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello has asked the federal government for a total of $94.4 billion in aid, including $31.1 billion for housing and $17.8 billion to rebuild its ruined power grid. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has so far approved more than $660 million in aid for individuals in Puerto Rico as well as more than $450 million in public assistance. Nielsen and Carson will receive detailed briefings on rebuilding efforts and see how federal aid is helping residents to recover, a DHS official said. Nielsen, who oversees FEMA, and Rossello are slated to hold a news conference. The visit comes as Congress prepares to vote on a tax overhaul bill that Puerto Rican officials have said they fear will hurt the commonwealth’s pharmaceutical manufacturing sector - the cornerstone of the island’s economy - at a time when Puerto Rico can least afford to lose jobs and tax revenue. Puerto Rico’s government has said 64 people died because of the hurricane, but after multiple media estimates of dramatically higher figures, Rossello on Monday ordered an official review of the death toll. \n","Generating links\n","Trump Cabinet officials to visit Puerto Rico to assess recovery\n","['https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-idUSKBN1ED026', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/new-probe-confirms-trump-officials-blocked-puerto-rico-receiving-hurri-rcna749', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-puertorico-idINL1N1OJ1FP', 'https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/353238-a-look-back-at-trumps-response-to-the-humanitarian-crisis-in-puerto/', 'https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/353238-a-look-back-at-trumps-response-to-the-humanitarian-crisis-in-puerto/', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/new-probe-confirms-trump-officials-blocked-puerto-rico-receiving-hurri-rcna749', 'https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/353238-a-look-back-at-trumps-response-to-the-humanitarian-crisis-in-puerto/', 'https://news.yahoo.com/trump-cabinet-officials-visit-puerto-rico-assess-recovery-003923905--business.html', 'https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/365575-trump-administration-officials-visiting-puerto-rico/', 'https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/353238-a-look-back-at-trumps-response-to-the-humanitarian-crisis-in-puerto/', 'https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/942920406121484288', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-gives-administration-10-puerto-rico-recovery-n812321', 'https://www.investing.com/news/politics/trump-cabinet-officials-to-visit-puerto-rico-to-assess-recovery-1007045', 'https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6byc5k']\n","Generating question-answers\n","question_ans :  [{'answer': 'Kirstjen Nielsen and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson', 'question': \"Who will travel to Puerto Rico to assess Puerto Rico's rebuilding?\"}, {'answer': '$81 billion', 'question': \"How much did the U.S. House of Representatives plan to spend on Puerto Rico's disaster aid package?\"}, {'answer': 'Texas and Florida', 'question': 'Which states were hit by other hurricanes and California?'}, {'answer': '$72 billion', 'question': 'How much debt did Puerto Rico have before Hurricane Maria?'}, {'answer': '$17.8 billion', 'question': \"How much did Ricardo Rossello ask for to rebuild Puerto Rico's power grid?\"}, {'answer': '$660 million', 'question': 'How much did the Federal Emergency Management Agency approve in aid for Puerto Rico?'}, {'answer': 'DHS', 'question': \"What is the name of the official who said the federal aid is helping Puerto Rico's residents to recover?\"}, {'answer': 'FEMA', 'question': \"What is the name of the agency that oversees Puerto Rico's rebuilding efforts?\"}, {'answer': 'tax overhaul bill', 'question': \"What is the name of the bill that Puerto Rican officials fear will hurt the commonwealth's pharmaceutical manufacturing sector?\"}, {'answer': '64', 'question': 'How many people died due to the hurricane?'}]\n","Generating answers with new links\n","Evaluating\n","matching_score :  60.0\n","sentence_bleu_score :  0.6\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"c0bf7b6f30f94fb0b2ba562863ade871","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"a59180ed8509465fb33e80f0c7e8942d","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["sbertSimilarity :  0.9116520881652832\n","Data point :  99 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate will not consider an immigration bill as part of year-end legislation but will turn to a measure protecting immigrant youths known as “Dreamers” in January, No. 2 Senate Republican John Cornyn said on Monday. Cornyn also said that if Congress cannot meet an early March deadline for passing legislation providing the protections against deportation for undocumented immigrants who were brought illegally into the United States as children, President Donald Trump could consider extending the deadline. In interviews over the past several days, both Republican and Democratic lawmakers and aides said that talks on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) have been quietly making progress. “The president has given us enough time to deal with this before March and so I think that’s plenty of time and I expect us to meet it,” Cornyn told reporters. “If we can’t, then the president could extend the deadline if he chose to do so. But this is something we’re going to turn to, I’m sure, in January.” Tensions between Republicans and Democrats over the issue of legislative protections for Dreamers increased this fall after Trump took a hard line on the conditions for a deal. An intense lobbying campaign has been underway to urge lawmakers to find a permanent legislative fix after the Republican president ended the DACA program in September. He gave Congress until early March to come up with a legislative replacement. On Capitol Hill, advocates have handed out buttons to lawmakers and aides with the number “122,” referring to the estimated number of Dreamers each day who already are losing the temporary legal status they had under DACA. Immigration advocates have erected a huge monitor on the National Mall. Situated at the base of the U.S. Capitol for lawmakers and tourists alike to see, it broadcasts videos of Dreamers pleading for help. Meanwhile, seven DACA beneficiaries from Mexico, Argentina and Colombia were in the fourth day of a hunger strike to draw attention to the issue. Republican Representative John Carter, a veteran of past immigration debates, said he worried Democrats want to go way beyond the scope of DACA and the approximately 800,000 Dreamers who at one time or another were covered by Democratic former President Barack Obama’s executive order. “They’re talking Dream Act,” Carter said referring to the legislation offered by Democratic Senator Dick Durbin and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. “And that number is about 2 million people. That’s too much.” Past legislative attempts to allow Dreamers to get work permits and drivers licenses, open bank accounts and “come out of the shadows” have stalled as conservative Republicans and lobbying groups objected to giving “amnesty” to anyone who entered the United States illegally - even those who had no choice in the matter and have grown up here. Democratic Representative Michelle Lujan Grisham, who chairs the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said Republican demands for additional resources for immigration enforcement throughout the United States and not just at the border are a major problem. Her concern is that the Trump administration might use the money to hire more federal agents to nab undocumented relatives of Dreamers. “If you’re going to come in and go to hospitals and go to courtrooms and go to schools” in search of family members, “I’m not going to do that,” she said in an interview. \n","Generating links\n","'Dreamer' immigration bill not on U.S. Senate agenda this
